## The Student Scheduling Assistant

The [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) was created to help students quickly build a workable class schedule.  It takes a list of courses a student is interested in and determines the class sections the student needs to take in order to get as many of the courses being requested as possible.  The [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) tries to calculate a schedule for the student based on the following criteria:

* the student’s priority for the course
* the student’s free time requests
* the student must be able to attend all parts of the course
* provide as many of the selected courses as possible
* the distance between back-to-back classes (if the distance between two classes is greater than a normal person can cover during the break time, a roadrunner icon is displayed)
* whether an overlap is allowed between two classes
* keep the existing schedule as much as possible
* alternative courses are only used if a selected course is not available
* a section choice that prevents the fewest future students from also getting the course

Once the assistant has suggested a schedule, a student can make changes to the schedule until they find a combination of times for the classes that meets their needs.

**Note:** Many sections only have one or two spaces available in them at any given time. If the [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) suggests one of these sections, it is a good idea to submit the schedule quickly by pressing the **Submit Schedule** button to be registered for it in myPurdue.  This is because the spaces may be taken by another student since the assistant does not block other students from registering for a suggested section.

## Navigating to the Student Scheduling Assistant

To use the [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant), go to myPurdue.purdue.edu and enter your career account name and password on the login screen and press the **Login** button.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-1.png){:class='screenshot'}

Find the **Registration** item along the top of the page and click on it.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-2.png){:class='screenshot'}

Find the **Register for Classes** card and click the **Scheduling Assistant** link.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-3.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

If there are multiple terms available for scheduling, a dialog with term choices will appear.  Select the term in which you want to register.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-6.png){:class='screenshot'}

The term in the upper right-hand corner will reflect the term you selected.

You may then be prompted to enter the registration PIN you received from your advisor.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-4.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

If you do not know your PIN, select the **Cancel** button and use the [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) to create the course schedule without the ability to submit it to myPurdue.  If the **Submit Schedule** button is present and you have not successfully entered your PIN, you will be prompted to enter it when you press the button.  If you do not correctly enter your PIN at this time, the request will not be submitted.

You can always review the **Session** in the upper-right corner to ensure the correct term is used for registration.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-5.png){:class='screenshot'}

If the term listed is incorrect, click on the term that is listed. 


## Configuring Your Course Requests

Depending on the status of your course registration, there are two possible screens you may be taken to when you enter the [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant).

## Case 1: not previously registered for any courses

If you have not previously registered for any courses, the [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) will display the Course Requests grid for entering your course requests.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-7.png){:class='screenshot'}

Enter all courses you wish to take in the **Course Requests** table.  You should enter the courses in descending order from your highest priority to your lowest priority.  If there is an alternative to any specific course you want to take, you can enter that information by using the ![+](../images/icon-filter-add.png) sign in the text box with the course.  This will add an indented line underneath the course request that can be used to enter an alternative course request.  The ![+](../images/icon-filter-add.png) sign can be selected as many times as needed.   Also, if you want to take a specific number of courses in order to make progress toward a degree, you may request a set of alternative courses that are acceptable if any course in the prioritized list is not available.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-8.png){:class='screenshot'}

From the Course Requests grid, you can add courses to your list by clicking the magnifying glass icon ![magnifying glass icon](../images/icon-finder.png). This opens a dialog that lets you search for courses.  You can enter a course number or a set of words that may be found in the title of the course.  The [Course Finder](../course-finder) dialog will display a set of courses that match your search criteria. You can click each course listed to see more details in the course catalog.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-9.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note 1:** Multiple courses can be selected using the checkboxes next to each course in order to provide alternatives. The courses will be listed in the order they have been toggled.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-10.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note 2:** The **![+](../images/icon-filter-open.gif) Filter** can be opened by clicking the ![+](../images/icon-filter-open.gif) icon, allowing for filtering the course by their dates (useful for Summer and Winter sessions), credits, and instructors.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-12.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note 3:** The checkboxes next to the instructional methods or individual sections can be used to provide preferences. 

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-12b.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once you have found the course you are looking for, double-click the course to select it, or hit the **Select** button.  This closes the window and populates the appropriate field in the Course Requests grid.

In addition to using the magnifying glass icon ![magnifying glass icon](../images/icon-finder.png) to bring up the [Course Finder](../course-finder) dialog. You can type your search directly into the input box, and it will show a drop-down list of courses that match your search criteria.  You can then select a course from the drop-down.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-11.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note:** The [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) may suggest multiple suffixed course offerings for a course number.  These are different variations of the same course.  These suffixes will not be shown in myPurdue.  Pay attention to the suffix to ensure you select the correct version for your needs.  For example, if you want to take an honors version of a course, you would pick the one with an H suffix and the word “- Honors” in the title.

You can also use the magnifying glass icon ![magnifying glass icon](../images/icon-finder.png) to enter free time requests from the course finder dialog.  To use the course finder dialog to enter a free time request, select the **Free Time** tab and click on each half-hour grid square that should be free, and a free time request will be built in the text box.  Clicking a grid square a second time deselects it.  Press the **Select** button or use the enter key to insert the free time request into the Course Requests grid.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-13.png){:class='screenshot'}

It is also possible to enter free time requests by typing them into the input box and selecting a suggestion.

**Note:** A high-priority free-time request may prevent the [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) from placing you into a lower-priority course if that course meets during the requested free time.

Continue filling in the course request input boxes until you have entered all your course and free time requests.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-14.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once you have entered your course and free time requests, press the **Build Schedule** ![&rarr;](../images/icon-right.png) button to get a suggested schedule.

## Case 2: you have an existing schedule

If you have an existing schedule, you will be shown your current list of classes.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-16.png){:class='screenshot'}

If you wish to add or remove courses from your schedule, you can navigate to the Course Requests grid as described below.

When adding classes to an existing schedule, the scheduling assistant tries to retain existing time placements; however, it may move class times to provide a more complete schedule.  Because of this, if you wish to guarantee that a time is retained on a particular class, you should select the lock icon ![lock](../images/icon-unlock.png) next to that class before navigating to the Course Requests grid.

**Note:** If you have been administratively pre-enrolled in courses such as those affiliated with learning communities, it is strongly recommended that you lock all associated courses to ensure the assistant does not try to move you into a different section before navigating to the Course Requests grid.

To navigate to the Course Requests grid and modify your course request, select the ![&larr](../images/icon-left.png) **Course Request** button.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-19.png){:class='screenshot'}

You can make changes to this list by adding courses to the empty spots in the grid.  To remove courses, use the trashcan icon ![trashcan](../images/icon-button-delete.png) to the right of the line associated with the course. To change priorities, use the up ![up](../images/icon-button-up.png) and down ![down](../images/icon-button-down.png) arrows. To submit a free time request, use the magnifying glass icon ![magnifying glass](../images/icon-finder.png) to take you to the [Course Finder](../course-finder) dialog where you can build a free time request. More experienced users may also enter a time statement covering the desired free time.

For more detailed information on the actions you can take on the Course Requests grid, see [Case 1](#case-1-not-previously-registered-for-any-courses) above.

**Note:** Course that you are currently not registered in are <strike style='color:#8b0000; font-style:italic;'>CROSSED OUT</strike>. To re-enable such a course, click the recycle icon ![recycle](../images/icon-recycle.png){:width=16px} next to the course.

Once you have modified your course and free time requests, press the **Build Schedule** ![&rarr;] (../images/icon-right.png) button in the bottom right-hand corner of the page to get a suggested schedule.

## Registering For Your Suggested Schedule

Once you have a suggested schedule, note the number of available spaces in each class.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-27.png){:class='screenshot'}

The **Avail** column on the **List of Classes** tab of the Class Schedule shows how many seats are still available out of the total seats for a section. If a class is filling up and the time is acceptable to you, you should complete registration for the class quickly by pressing the **Submit Schedule** button in the bottom right-hand corner of the page so that you are officially enrolled in that class.  Otherwise, other students seeking this class may enroll in the last available space ahead of you.

**Note:** If a class requires permission from an instructor or department, it will be noted in the **Requires** column for that class.  The permission must be recorded in the system before you can successfully enroll in the class.

You can also view your suggested schedule as a time grid by selecting the **Time Grid** tab.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-29.png){:class='screenshot'}

Review the suggested schedule.  If you are happy with the schedule, press the **Submit Schedule** button.

This will send the request to myPurdue for additional validation, and you will be registered for all courses that pass myPurdue's validation.  If any course fails validation, information about the failure will be shown in the lower portion of the screen.  All successful registrations will be displayed immediately in the Scheduling Assistant.  For examples of messages that may appear when myPurdue validation fails, go to the [Registration Errors](#registration-errors) section at the end of this document.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-30.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

Once you have registered for courses in myPurdue, that information will flow back into UniTime and, after a short delay, should be reflected in the [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant). If you have used the **Submit Schedule** button in the Scheduling Assistant, and all sections were successfully enrolled, you will see a **Success!** message, and each section will have a green checkmark ![checkmark](../images/icon-tick.png) listed next to it. Sections that failed the validation will show a red exclamation mark icon ![!](../images/icon-problem.png) next to them. Clicking the icon will also show the corresponding registration error.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-33.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note:** If you receive an error message rather than a **Success!** message, it is your responsibility to look at the error message and take the appropriate action.  If you are unsure what action to take, consult your academic advisor. If allowed, you can request an approval for the registration error by pressing the **Request Approvals** button on the **Registration Errors** dialog shown above.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-34.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

Multiple approvals can be requested at once. Please provide an explanation for each of the approvals requested, read and check the disclaimer, and click the **Request Approvals** button to request the approval(s). See more details in the [Registration Errors](#registration-errors) section at the end of this document.

## Making Changes to Your Schedule

If you wish to make changes to your schedule, first decide which classes you want to keep at the suggested time.  Any such classes should be locked.  This can be done on the **List of Classes** tab by clicking the lock icon ![lock](../images/icon-unlock.png) next to a class.  You do not have to lock any of the classes.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-35.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

It is also possible to lock a class on the **Time Grid** tab by clicking the lock icon ![lock](../images/icon-unlock.png).

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-37.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

Classes can be unlocked at any time by clicking the lock icon a second time.

If you want to change the courses in your suggested schedule, you can press the ![&larr](../images/icon-left.png) **Add/Drop Courses** button and go back to the Course Requests grid.

Another method for adding a course to your schedule is to click the green plus icon ![+](../images/icon-plus.png) with the **New Course** label next to it at the bottom left of the **List of Classes** tab.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-39.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

This will bring up the new course selection dialog.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-40.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once you have selected the course you want to add, you will be taken to the [Choices](../alternatives-for-class) dialog, which shows you the options for adding the course to your schedule.  The course you are adding will be shown in blue. If there are any changes to the schedule for other courses, they will be shown in black.  Any courses removed from the schedule will be shown in red.  To complete the course addition, select the option you want.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-41.png){:class='screenshot'}

It is also possible to delete a course from your schedule by clicking a section of the course on the **List Of Classes** tab or the **Time Grid** tab and selecting the **Drop** button in the [Alternatives](../alternatives-for-class) dialog.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-42.png){:class='screenshot'}

If you want to discard all current changes and see the courses you are currently registered for, press the **Current Registration** button.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-43.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note:** Clicking on the **Current Registration** button will discard any unsubmitted changes you have made to your schedule.

To change the time or location of a class, click on the class, and the [Student Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) will provide you with a [list of alternatives](../alternatives-for-class) for changes that can be made to move the class.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-44.png){:class='screenshot'}

This list may include alternatives that shuffle one or more classes, in addition to the selected individual class.  If you do not like any of the alternatives, you can click outside the window or the close icon ![close](../images/icon-dialog-close.png) and no changes will be made to your suggested schedule.  If you like one of the alternatives, you can click on it, and your proposed schedule will be updated to reflect the change.

**Notes:**
* If a class is offered at the same time in multiple rooms, the first alternatives will be for room changes for that class, followed by time changes.
* The best alternative for any relocation of a class is shown, not all possibilities.  The assistant does not show multiple rooms for a time move
* If a class becomes unassigned as a result of an alternative, it is shown in red.
* The filter can be used to change the list of alternatives shown.  You can hover your mouse over the filter field to see instructions for using the filter.
* If you want to explore conflicting cases (e.g., over the limit or a time conflict) for which an override can be requested, check the **Include conflicting suggestions** toggle in the lower right-hand corner of the dialog. 

When you mouse over an alternative, a pop-up of the schedule grid showing the complete schedule with the change will be displayed.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-45.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once you have selected a change, you are returned to the **Time Grid** or **List of Classes** tab, and your schedule is updated with the selection.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-46.png){:class='screenshot'}

If you are already registered for classes and making changes to your suggested schedule, you will see both the added and removed classes in the **List of Classes** tab.  The added classes have a green plus icon ![+](../images/icon-plus.png) in the last column.  The unchanged classes have a green check icon ![check](../images/icon-tick.png) in the last column.  The removed classes are in greyed-italic font and have a red cross icon ![x](../images/icon-cross.png) in the last column.  You can use these indicators to determine which CRNs will be added or dropped when you press the **Submit Schedule** button to update your registration in myPurdue.  Once you have completed all of your changes to your schedule, click the **Submit Schedule** button to submit your registration changes to myPurdue.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-47.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Important:** No changes are made to your schedule without clicking the **Submit Schedule** button. This is also reflected in the displayed warning!

Please note that if there are both sections being added and deleted, there are the following outcomes:
1. All changes have been made (your new schedule has all the requested changes included), and the **Success** message is shown.
2. There have been one or more registration errors. No changes to your schedule have been made in this case. If it is possible to request approval(s) for all the registration errors, the option to **Request Approvals** will show up.

The only exception is when all sections are being added (there is no course being dropped or section swapped). In this case, the system may enroll you in some courses (those without registration errors).

## Printing Your Schedule

If you want a printed copy of your schedule, press the **Print** button in the lower right-hand corner, and it will print to the local printer.  If a printed copy is not needed, you can log out of the system.

The print output formats your suggested schedule grid and class list into one document.

## Subscribing to a Calendar Feed of Your Schedule

If you would like to subscribe to a calendar feed of your schedule in UniTime, select the **Personal Schedule** menu item.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-52.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once you are on the Personal Schedule page, select the **Export** button on the right-hand side of the page above the schedule.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-53.png){:class='screenshot'}

This will display a menu of exports that can be run for your personal schedule.  Select the **Export iCalendar** item from the list of options displayed.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-54.png){:class='screenshot'}

A dialog will appear with a URL that can be used with your calendar tool of choice to subscribe to your personal schedule for the academic term.  Follow your calendaring tool’s instructions for subscribing to the calendar URL provided.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-55.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note:** Subscribing to the URL provided rather than just importing it into your calendar allows your calendar to be automatically updated if changes are made to the courses in your schedule and when evening and final exams are published.

## Registration Errors

The [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) communicates with myPurdue to validate your PIN and eligibility to register when you open the assistant and select an academic session. It also communicates with myPurdue to validate your schedule request and enroll you in the courses that pass validation when the **Submit Schedule** button is pressed.  This section contains some samples of messages that may be returned to you as a result of the interaction between myPurdue and the Scheduling Assistant.  The examples are not meant to be an exhaustive collection of all messages that could be received.  You need to review any error messages returned and determine the action you need to take.  If you are unsure what action to take, contact your advisor.

When you first click on the **Scheduling Assistant** menu item, it will check with myPurdue to see if you are eligible to register for classes at that time.  The best situation is that you are eligible to register at that time, and you have entered a valid PIN.  In this case, no message will appear at the bottom of the screen, and when you are on the **List of Classes** tab or the **Time Grid** tab, you will have the **Submit Schedule** button available to you.  If you have not submitted your schedule to myPurdue, there will also be a message stating:

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-56.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

reminding you to submit it at the bottom of the screen.

The **Submit Schedule** button lets you submit your schedule to myPurdue once you are happy with it.  The **Submit Schedule** button sends your schedule request to myPurdue for additional validation and registers you for all courses that pass validation.  If you have requested a course(s) to be dropped, you will see the following message asking for confirmation before the system proceeds to drop the course(s):

*Together with other registration changes, the course ... will be dropped. Do you want to proceed?*

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-57.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

When all courses pass validation, and you are registered in your courses, you receive a **Success!** message from myPurdue, and the courses display a check icon.[check](../images/icon-tick.png) in the last column, indicating that you are enrolled.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-59.png){:class='screenshot'}

As mentioned earlier, when you first enter the [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant), it communicates with myPurdue to see if you are eligible to register for classes at that time.  A variety of messages may be returned if you are not eligible to register for classes at the time the check is processed.  Messages from myPurdue are displayed to you at the bottom of the screen.  If you are not eligible to register, you can still use the [Scheduling Assistant](../student-scheduling-assistant) to look at potential course schedules; in some cases, the **Submit Schedule** button will still be present.  At the time you click the **Submit Schedule** button, it will perform the eligibility to register checks again. If the checks are successful, it will attempt to register you to your course schedule; if the checks fail, you will receive an error message.

Below is a sampling of messages that may be returned from myPurdue, indicating you will not be able to register for classes.

***Your PIN is invalid.***

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-60.png){:class='screenshot'}

***Holds prevent registration.***
***Student Status prevents registration.***

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-61.png){:class='screenshot'}

If a course request fails to pass validation by myPurdue when you press the **Submit Schedule** button, messages will be displayed at the bottom of the screen noting the reason the validation failed, and the courses themselves will be listed in red and will still have a plus icon ![+](../images/icon-add.png) as well as an exclamation icon ![!](../images/icon-problem.png) in the last column to indicate a problem occurred.  Any courses that have passed validation will have a check icon![check](../images/icon-tick.png) in the last column indicates you were successfully registered for that course.

There are various reasons a course request may not pass myPurdue validation.  It is your responsibility to review the returned message and take the appropriate action.  If you are unsure what to do, you should contact your advisor.

Below are a few examples of messages you may receive from myPurdue when a course request fails validation.

*Permission from Department Prerequisite error.  See the Schedule of Classes.*

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-65.png){:class='screenshot'}

*Field of Study Restriction - Major*

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-66.png){:class='screenshot'}

*Prerequisite error.  See the Schedule of Classes.*

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-67.png){:class='screenshot'}

## Registration Workflow

If allowed, you can request an approval for the registration error or errors by pressing the **Request Approvals** button on the **Registration Errors** dialog shown above.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-34.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

Multiple approvals can be requested at once. Please provide an explanation for each of the approvals requested, read and check the disclaimer, and click the **Request Approvals** button to request the approval(s). Once an approval is submitted, it appears in the **Approval Requests** table. You can track the progress of your requests there.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-68.png){:class='screenshot'}

Once it has been approved, click the request to apply it to your current schedule, then click **Submit Schedule** to make the change.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-69.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note 1:** Please note that one request is created for all the changes that may include both sections being added and dropped from your current schedule. For example, you can swap one course for another, and the change will be made only when all required approvals have been obtained.

**Note 2:** If you have requested two courses to be added within a single change, the request will be approved only after approvals for both courses have been approved. If possible, the two courses do not need to be taken concurrently; it is advised to add one course first (and submit approvals for it) and then add the second course, so that there are separate approvals for each of the courses.

## Grade Modes & Variable Credits

Some courses may allow for changing of the grade mode and/or credit hours. To request a change, click the **Grade Modes & Credits** button. This will pop up a **Grade Modes & Variable Credits** dialog. The available options for the credit and grade mode changes are shown as drop-downs. Based on the change, approval may be needed.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-70.png){:class='screenshot'}

Select the desired change or changes, and if an approval is needed, provide a reason for each of the courses that require approval. Click **Submit Changes** to make the changes and/or request the necessary approvals. If approval is required, the credit hours and/or grade mode are automatically updated once approval is granted. You can monitor the progress in the **Approval Requests** table. The current credit and the grade mode show in the **List of Classes** tab, columns **Credit** and **Gr Md** (move over the grade mode to see the full name of the grade mode).

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-71.png){:class='screenshot'}

**Note 1:** Clicking **Current Registration** will not only discard the current changes and go back to the current registration, it will also refresh the **Approval Requests** table.

**Note 2:** A pending approval request can be cancelled by clicking the trashcan icon at the right-hand side ![trash can](../images/icon-button-delete.png) of the approval request.

## Variable Title Courses

Because variable title courses are created based on the requested course title, there is a special way to request a variable title course. To do so, click the ![+](../images/icon-plus.png) **Variable Title Course** button and the bottom of the **List of Classes** table. 

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-72.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

Once clicked, the **Request Variable Title Course** dialog will appear.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-73.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

1. First, type in the **Course**. As you type, you will be prompted with matching variable title courses from the catalog.
2. Once a course is selected, the **Details** are automatically populated. These are from the catalog and cannot be changed.
3. Type in the requested course **Title**
4. Select the number of **Credit** hours based on the discussion with your advisor or instructor
5. Select the course instructor. The instructor will be automatically asked to approve the course for you. They may also adjust the title and credits if needed.
    - If the instructor is not on the list, select the **None of the above** option at the bottom of the list and put the name of the instructor in the **Note**.
6. Select the **Grade Mode**, if something else than **Regular Grade** is needed.
7. Select the **Dates** if the course will not take the whole term.
8. Put in additional **Note** and click **Request Course**

Once requested, you will see the request for a variable title course in the **Approval Requests** table. You will be registered in the variable title course automatically once the request is approved.

![Student Scheduling Assistant](images/scheduling-assistant-purdue-74.png){:class='screenshot' style='width:50%;'}

**Note:** A pending approval request can be cancelled by clicking the trashcan icon on the right-hand side ![trash can](../images/icon-button-delete.png) of the approval request.

## Wait-Listing

If a course and the student status allow for wait-listing, it can be wait-listed on the **Course Requests** table using the **Wait-List** checkbox. Suppose the course is not available for the student, e.g., because it is full. In that case, it can also be wait-listed on the **List of Classes** (using the **Wait-List** checkbox on the line with the course) or on the [Alternatives](../alternatives-for-class) dialog when the course/class is clicked (using the **Wait-List** button).

![Student Scheduling Assistant](../images/student-scheduling-assistant-6.png){:class='screenshot'}

Additional properties can be entered on the [Wait-List Preferences](../wait-list-preferences-for-a-course) dialog when the wait-listed course is clicked from the **List of Classes** table.

Do not forget to click the **Submit Schedule** to persist your changes, including wait-listing the selected course(s) and/or updating your wait-listing preferences. Once submitted, the wait-listed courses will also appear in a separate table below the **Class Schedule**. Clicking on a wait-listed course in this table will also open the [Wait-List Preferences](../wait-list-preferences-for-a-course) for the course.

It is possible to wait-list for a course swap or a different section of the same course. In this case, the enrolled course that is to be replaced with the wait-listed course is selected on the [Wait-List Preferences](../wait-list-preferences-for-a-course) dialog. The original course is then also listed in the **Wait-Listed Courses** table (**Replaces** column).

If the wait-listed course has alternatives provided on the **Course Requests**, these courses are also being wait-listed if they allow for wait-listing. That is, if space becomes available for the student in the alternative course before there is space available in the first-choice course, UniTime will enroll the student in the alternative course instead. The alternative courses are also listed in the **Wait-Listed Courses** table and in the [Wait-List Preferences](../wait-list-preferences-for-a-course) dialog.

It is possible that a course to be wait-listed requires some overrides. If that is the case, you will be given the option to request the necessary approvals in order to wait-list the course using the [Registration Workflow](#registration-workflow) when you click the **Submit Schedule** button. The wait-list will not be active until the approval is requested and given, but your position on the wait-list is determined by when the wait-list was created.
