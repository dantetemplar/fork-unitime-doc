The following fields may be populated for a student group:

* **Code:**  A short name for the student group type
* **Name:**  A long name for the student group type
* **Keep Students Together:**  This should be checked if it is desired that the student sectioning solver try to put students of this type of group into the same sections when they request the same courses.
* **Disabled Sections:** This determines how to handle the students in groups of this type in relation to sections that are *Disabled for Student Scheduling*.  This is the equivalent of “No Print” in Banner.  For the student scheduling solver to place a student into one of these sections special handling is required.
	* **Not Allowed:** Students in student groups of this type are not allowed to be placed in a section that is *Disabled for Student Scheduling*.
	* **Allowed with Group Reservation:**  Students in student groups of this type are allowed to be placed in a section that is *Disabled for Student Scheduling* if there is a corresponding student group reservation.
	* **Always Allowed:**  Students in student groups of this type are allowed to be placed in a section that is *Disabled for Student Scheduling*.
* **Advisors Can Set:** This should be checked if advisors are assigned to students within the system and advisors should have the ability to assign students to the student groups of this type using the Online Student Scheduling Dashboard.
